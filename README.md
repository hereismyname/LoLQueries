# LoLQueries

Some (unsophisticated) R code used to query Riot's API to gather summoner stats.

Long-term goal is to convert the code into a more formal package that can handle queries more automatically, similar to something like the excellent [acs package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/acs/index.html).
